## [How it works](#How-it-works)

ImageVS provides support for embedding image files right into a Git repository as a binary file that can be edited, and has a revision history. A hex editor can be used to edit the files. Similar to Wikimedia commons, a revision history for each file is available.

VS = Version Supercontrol

No original draft for this project exists, as one was not written at the time of inception, other than this:

```plain-text
ImageVS
PNGVS
JPEGVS
TIFVS
BMPVS
HEIFVS
WEBPVS
NETPVS
GIFVS
JP2VS
SVGVS
```

## [Languages used](#Languages-used)

### [Perl](#Perl)

#### [Why write ImageVS in Perl](#Why-write-ImageVS-in-Perl)

The project could have been done in C, but Perl doesn't get enough use, and is also suitable here. I felt like giving Perl a chance here. It is mostly done for software diversity reasons.

### [Pod](#Pod)

Pod is used for documentation instead of Markdown. The transition of core documentation to Pod will come in the future.
